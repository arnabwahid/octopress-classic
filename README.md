### Why use this theme?
I really like the Octopress default theme, I think it looks great for a tech blog, and very readable. As I somewhat despise the ___designing___ part of a theme, I just started on top on the explicitely fine-tuned Octopress static template. Hey! The classic octopress theme itself was based on the Twenty Twelve WordPress Theme!

### Why didn't you use Octopress?
Octopress at this point is abandoned. There is not really any reason not to move on.

### The theme is missing XXX
I made this theme for my blog, just for personal use; which requred very few features to begin with. If you want to add __XXX__ feature to this theme, please feel free to fork it, add it, and submit a pull request, I'll be happy to merge it and put your name among the contributors list.

### Enabling Features

__Syntax Highlighting:__ You can use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or any other alternative with `solarized-dark` style, and you will get exact same highlight that is used in the original Octopress theme. Addition css classes has been taken care of.

__Linklog:__ Linklog support is already built in in the theme loops. Use The [DFLL plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/daring-fireball-linked-list/) to write linked list posts.
