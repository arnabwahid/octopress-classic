# Octopress Classic Theme for WordPress
The Octopress Classic Theme Ported to WordPress
---

### Why use this theme?
I really like the Octopress default theme, I think is stanard looking and very readable. As I somewhat despise the ___designing___ part of a theme, I just started on top on the explicitely fine-tuned Octopress static template. Hey! The classic octopress theme itself was based on the Twenty Twelve WordPress Theme!

### Why didn't you use Octopress?
Let's just say, I have tinkered with all the static site generators out there. At the end of the day, none of those are close to becoming an alternative for WordPress. The ease of use that WordPress provides is unmatched. Instead of using 10 third party hosted services to enable core functionalities like comments and contact forms on your ___static___ site, all that is already built into WordPress core. Besides, Octopress at this point is abandoned. There is not really any reason not to move on.

### The theme is missing XXX
I made this theme for my blog, just for personal use; which requred very few features to begin with. If you want to add __XXX__ feature to this theme, please feel free to fork it, add it, and submit a pull request, I'll be happy to merge it and put your name among the contributors list.

### Enabling Features

##### Syntax Highlighting:
You can use __highlight.js__ or any other alternative with `solarized-dark` style, and you will get exact same highlight that is used in the original Octopress theme. Addition css classes has been taken care of.

##### Linklog:
Linklog support is already built in in the theme loops. Use The DFLL plugin to write linked list posts.
